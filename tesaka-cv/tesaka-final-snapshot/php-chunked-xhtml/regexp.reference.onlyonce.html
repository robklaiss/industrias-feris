  <p class="para">
   With both maximizing and minimizing repetition, failure of
   what follows normally causes the repeated item to be
   re-evaluated to see if a different number of repeats allows the
   rest of the pattern to match. Sometimes it is useful to
   prevent this, either to change the nature of the match, or
   to cause it fail earlier than it otherwise might, when the
   author of the pattern knows there is no point in carrying
   on.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   Consider, for example, the pattern \d+foo when applied to
   the subject line

   <code class="literal">123456bar</code>
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   After matching all 6 digits and then failing to match &quot;foo&quot;,
   the normal action of the matcher is to try again with only 5
   digits matching the \d+ item, and then with 4, and so on,
   before ultimately failing. Once-only subpatterns provide the
   means for specifying that once a portion of the pattern has
   matched, it is not to be re-evaluated in this way, so the
   matcher would give up immediately on failing to match &quot;foo&quot;
   the first time. The notation is another kind of special
   parenthesis, starting with (?&gt; as in this example:

   <code class="literal">(?&gt;\d+)bar</code>
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   This kind of parenthesis &quot;locks up&quot; the part of the pattern
   it contains once it has matched, and a failure further into
   the pattern is prevented from backtracking into it.
   Backtracking past it to previous items, however, works as normal.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   An alternative description is that a subpattern of this type
   matches the string of characters that an identical standalone
   pattern would match, if anchored at the current point
   in the subject string.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   Once-only subpatterns are not capturing subpatterns. Simple
   cases such as the above example can be thought of as a maximizing
   repeat that must swallow everything it can. So,
   while both \d+ and \d+? are prepared to adjust the number of
   digits they match in order to make the rest of the pattern
   match, (?&gt;\d+) can only match an entire sequence of digits.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   This construction can of course contain arbitrarily complicated
   subpatterns, and it can be nested.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   Once-only subpatterns can be used in conjunction with
   lookbehind assertions to specify efficient matching at the end
   of the subject string. Consider a simple pattern such as

   <code class="literal">abcd$</code>

   when applied to a long string which does not match. Because
   matching proceeds from left to right, PCRE will look for
   each &quot;a&quot; in the subject and then see if what follows matches
   the rest of the pattern. If the pattern is specified as

   <code class="literal">^.*abcd$</code>

   then the initial .* matches the entire string at first, but
   when this fails (because there is no following &quot;a&quot;), it
   backtracks to match all but the last character, then all but
   the last two characters, and so on. Once again the search
   for &quot;a&quot; covers the entire string, from right to left, so we
   are no better off. However, if the pattern is written as

   <code class="literal">^(?&gt;.*)(?&lt;=abcd)</code>

   then there can be no backtracking for the .* item; it can
   match only the entire string. The subsequent lookbehind
   assertion does a single test on the last four characters. If
   it fails, the match fails immediately. For long strings,
   this approach makes a significant difference to the processing time.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   When a pattern contains an unlimited repeat inside a subpattern
   that can itself be repeated an unlimited number of
   times, the use of a once-only subpattern is the only way to
   avoid some failing matches taking a very long time indeed.
   The pattern

   <code class="literal">(\D+|&lt;\d+&gt;)*[!?]</code>

   matches an unlimited number of substrings that either consist
   of non-digits, or digits enclosed in &lt;&gt;, followed by
   either ! or ?. When it matches, it runs quickly. However, if
   it is applied to

   <code class="literal">aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa</code>

   it takes a long time before reporting failure. This is
   because the string can be divided between the two repeats in
   a large number of ways, and all have to be tried. (The example
   used [!?] rather than a single character at the end,
   because both PCRE and Perl have an optimization that allows
   for fast failure when a single character is used. They
   remember the last single character that is required for a
   match, and fail early if it is not present in the string.)
   If the pattern is changed to

   <code class="literal">((?&gt;\D+)|&lt;\d+&gt;)*[!?]</code>

   sequences of non-digits cannot be broken, and failure happens quickly.
