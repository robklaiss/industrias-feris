 <h1 class="title">Persistent Database Connections</h1>


 <div class="simplesect">
  <h3 class="title">What are Persistent Connections?</h3>
  <p class="simpara">
   Persistent connections are links that do not close when the
   execution of your script ends. When a persistent connection is
   requested, PHP checks if there&#039;s already an identical persistent
   connection (that remained open from earlier) - and if it exists, it
   uses it. If it does not exist, it creates the link. An &#039;identical&#039;
   connection is a connection that was opened to the same host, with
   the same username and the same password (where applicable).
  </p>
  <p class="simpara">
   There&#039;s no method of requesting a specific connection, or guaranteeing
   whether you get an existing connection or a brand new one (if all existing
   connections are in use, or the request is being served by a different worker,
   which has a separate pool of connections).
  </p>
  <p class="simpara">
   This means that you cannot use PHP&#039;s persistent connections to, for example:
  </p>
  <ul class="simplelist">
   <li>assign a specific database session to a specific web user</li>
   <li>create a large transaction across multiple requests</li>
   <li>initiate a query on one request and collect the results on another</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="simpara">
   Persistent connections do not give you <em>any</em>
   functionality that wasn&#039;t possible with non-persistent connections.
  </p>
 </div>

 <div class="simplesect" id="persistent-connections.web">
  <h3 class="title">Web Requests</h3>
  <p class="simpara">
   There are two ways in which your web server can utilize PHP to generate
   web pages:
  </p>
  <p class="simpara">
   The first method is to use PHP as a CGI &quot;wrapper&quot;. When run this
   way, an instance of the PHP interpreter is created and destroyed
   for every page request (for a PHP page) to your web server.
   Because it is destroyed after every request, any resources that it
   acquires (such as a link to an SQL database server) are closed when
   it is destroyed. In this case, you do not gain anything from trying
   to use persistent connections - they simply don&#039;t persist.
  </p>
  <p class="simpara">
   The second, and most popular, method is to run PHP-FPM, or PHP as a module
   in a multiprocess web server, which currently only includes Apache.
   These setups typically have one process (the parent) which
   coordinates a set of processes (its children) who actually do the
   work of serving up web pages. When a request comes in from a
   client, it is handed off to one of the children that is not already
   serving another client. This means that when the same client makes
   a second request to the server, it may be served by a different
   child process than the first time. When opening a persistent connection,
   every following page requesting SQL services can reuse the same
   established connection to the SQL server.
  </p>
  <blockquote class="note"><p><strong class="note">Note</strong>: 
   <p class="para">
   You can check which method your web requests use by checking the value of
   &quot;Server API&quot; in the output of <span class="function"><a href="function.phpinfo.html" class="function">phpinfo()</a></span> or the value of
   <strong><code><a href="reserved.constants.html#constant.php-sapi">PHP_SAPI</a></code></strong>, run from a web request.
   </p>
   <p class="para">
    If the Server API is &quot;Apache 2 Handler&quot; or &quot;FPM/FastCGI&quot;, then persistent
    connections will be used across requests served by the same worker. For any
    other value, persistent connections will not persist after each request.
   </p>
  </p></blockquote>
 </div>

 <div class="simplesect" id="persistent-connections.cli">
  <h3 class="title">Command-line Processes</h3>
  <p class="simpara">
   As command-line PHP uses a new process for each script, persistent
   connections are not shared between command-line scripts, so there is no
   value in using them in transient scripts such as crons or commands.
   However, they may be useful if, for example, you&#039;re writing a long-running
   application server that serves many requests or tasks and each may need
   their own database connection.
  </p>
 </div>

 <div class="simplesect" id="persistent-connections.why">
  <h3 class="title">Why Use Them?</h3>
  <p class="simpara">
   Persistent connections are good if the overhead to create a link to your
   SQL server is high. Whether or not this overhead is really high depends
   on many factors. Like, what kind of database it is, whether or not
   it sits on the same computer on which your web server sits, how
   loaded the machine the SQL server sits on is and so forth. The
   bottom line is that if that connection overhead is high, persistent
   connections help you considerably. They cause the child process to
   simply connect only once for its entire lifespan, instead of every
   time it processes a page that requires connecting to the SQL
   server. This means that for every child that opened a persistent
   connection will have its own open persistent connection to the
   server. For example, if you had 20 different child processes that
   ran a script that made a persistent connection to your SQL server,
   you&#039;d have 20 different connections to the SQL server, one from
   each child.
  </p>
 </div>

 <div class="simplesect" id="persistent-connections.drawbacks.conn-limits">
  <h3 class="title">Potential Drawbacks: Connection Limits</h3>
  <p class="simpara">
   Note, however, that this can have some drawbacks if you are using a
   database with connection limits that are exceeded by persistent
   child connections. If your database has a limit of 16 simultaneous
   connections, and in the course of a busy server session, 17 child
   threads attempt to connect, one will not be able to. If there are
   bugs in your scripts which do not allow the connections to shut
   down (such as infinite loops), the database with only 16 connections
   may be rapidly swamped.
  </p>
  <p class="simpara">
   Persistent connections will usually increase the number of connections open
   at any given time because idle workers will still hold the connections for
   the previous requests they served. If a large number of workers is spun up to
   handle an influx of requests, the connections they opened will remain until
   the worker is killed or the database server closes the connection.
  </p>
  <p class="simpara">
   Ensure that the maximum number of connections allowed by the database server
   is greater than the maximum number of web request workers (plus any other
   usage such as crons or administrative connections).
  </p>
  <p class="simpara">
   Check your database documentation for information on handling abandoned or
   idle connections (timeouts). Long timeouts may significantly increase the
   number of persistent connections open at any one time.
  </p>
 </div>

 <div class="simplesect" id="persistent-connections.drawbacks.state">
  <h3 class="title">Potential Drawbacks: Maintaining Connection State</h3>
  <p class="simpara">
   Some database extensions perform automatic cleanup when the connection is
   reused; others leave this task at the discretion of the application developer.
   Depending on the chosen database extension and the application design, manual
   cleanup may be needed before the script exits. Changes that may leave
   connections in an unexpected state include:
  </p>
  <ul class="simplelist">
   <li>Selected / default database</li>
   <li>Table locks</li>
   <li>Uncommitted transactions</li>
   <li>Temporary tables</li>
   <li>Connection specific settings or features such as profiling</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="simpara">
   Table locks and transactions that are not cleaned up or closed may cause
   other queries to be blocked indefinitely and/or cause subsequent reuse of
   the connection to cause unexpected changes.
  </p>
  <p class="simpara">
   Having the wrong database selected will cause subsequent reuse of the
   connection to be unable to execute queries as expected (or execute them on
   the wrong database if schemas are similar enough).
  </p>
  <p class="simpara">
   If temporary tables are not cleaned up, subsequent requests will not be able
   to recreate the same table.
  </p>
  <p class="simpara">
   You can implement cleanup using class destructors or
   <span class="function"><a href="function.register-shutdown-function.html" class="function">register_shutdown_function()</a></span>. You may also want to
   consider dedicated connection pooling proxies that include this as part of
   their functionality.
  </p>
 </div>

 <div class="simplesect" id="persistent-connections.final-words">
  <h3 class="title">Final Words</h3>
  <p class="simpara">
   Given their behavior and potential drawbacks described above, you should not
   use persistent connections without careful consideration. They should not be
   used without implementing additional changes to your application and careful
   configuration of your database server and web server and/or PHP-FPM.
  </p>
  <p class="simpara">
   Consider alternative solutions such as investigating and fixing the causes of
   connection creation overheads (for example, disabling reverse DNS lookups on
   the database server), or dedicated connection pooling proxies.
  </p>
  <p class="simpara">
   For high volume web APIs, consider using alternative runtimes or long-running
   application servers.
